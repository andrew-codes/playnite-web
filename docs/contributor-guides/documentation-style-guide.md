## Spelling and Grammar

Use American English. 

## Headings

If a heading refers to instructions, use present tense and don't include "How To". For example: "Report a Bug".

## Notes

- Highlight important information in notes. 
- Notes should immediately follow the heading of the section where they appear.
- Put notes inside a Markdown blockquote and start the note with "**Note:**". 

## Contractions

- Use contractions, except when warning against an action in a note. 
- In notes, write "do not" rather than "don't" so that the warning is easier to read at a glance.

## Numbers

- Write numbers from one to ten. 
- For 0 and numbers greater than ten, use numerals. 

## Bold and Italics

- Use bold sparingly for emphasis. Make sure bold text stands out by avoiding overuse. 
- Don't use italics for emphasis.

## Markdown Formatting

- **Bold Text:** Use double asterisks for bold text.
- **Bulleted Lists:** Use hyphens for bulleted lists.
