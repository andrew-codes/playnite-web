        "description": "For the first time in over 20 years, we are heralding the return of a much loved piece of gaming history with the classic RPG, Wasteland!  <br><br>Mutants. Again. Even more than there were last time: they seem to materialize out of the very grains of the radioactive desert sand. Venomous yellow eyes. The black gunmetal glint of Uzis as they close in for the kill. There's nowhere to run, and nothing to rely on but your MAC 17 machine gun. What a way to save the human race.<br><br>The year is 2087, eighty-nine years after an all out nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union turned vast swaths of the Earth into a hellish wasteland where survival is a daily struggle against thirst, hunger, radiation sickness, ravaging raiders, and mutants - always mutants. You are a Desert Ranger, one of a band of stalwart lawmen born from the remnants of a U.S. Army detachment who survived the nuclear holocaust by holing up in a maximum security prison. You may wear ragtag uniforms and carry make-shift weapons, but the Desert Rangers are the only law left in what was once the American southwest.  <br><br>Now something more secretive and sinister than the usual roving bands of mutants and raiders is menacing humanity, and it's your job to investigate. Recruit the help you need, follow any leads you find, but beware. The wasteland is lawless desert and a lonely place, and the choices you make will shape the world around you. Better choose wisely. Your life depends on it.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>The godfather of the modern post-apocalyptic cRPG<br></strong></li><li><strong>One of the first reactive and immersive worlds that delivered persistent consequences to player choices<br></strong></li><li><strong>Featuring toggle-able modern updates such as new paragraph voice over, new music tracks and updated portraits.  Play in classic mode to get the original experience<br></strong></li><li><strong>Awarded &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; in 1988 by Computer Gaming World<br></strong></li><li><strong>Contains backstory and tie-ins to its long-awaited direct sequel, Wasteland 2, coming soon for digital download through Steam!</strong></li></ul>",

For more than 20 years, 3DMark has been the first choice for benchmarking, testing, and comparing PC performance.<br><br>There'll always be a new game that demands more performance from your hardware. And there'll always be new hardware that delivers more performance for your games. And so the cycle continues. Welcome to 3DMark, the Gamer's Benchmark.<br><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/223850/extras/3dmark_steam_top_rota_v3_15fps.gif?t=1750844716\" /></div><br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/223850/extras/for-gamers-en.png?t=1750844716\" /></div><br>3DMark includes everything gamers need to benchmark and compare PC performance. It has dedicated tests for all types of PC from lightweight laptops to dedicated desktops. 3DMark will recommend the best benchmark for your hardware.<br><br>3DMark tests your system's GPU and CPU performance by rendering extremely demanding game-like scenes in real time. The faster the benchmark runs, the better your score. Now your quest begins. What can you do to get a better score?<br><br>Start by comparing your 3DMark score with results from other systems with the same hardware. Lower than average scores may indicate a problem with cooling, configuration, or faulty components. Higher than average scores show the potential for overclocking your hardware. And if you‚Äôre wondering what your 3DMark score means for real-world game performance, 3DMark also shows you the frame rates you can expect in a selection of popular games.<br><br>Now see how much more performance you can get from your system. Update your drivers. Update Windows. Experiment with system settings. Run 3DMark after every change to track your progress. Identify bottlenecks in your system and compare 3DMark scores to help choose your next upgrade. Ask for advice, share tips, and show off your system in the 3DMark Community Hub on Steam.<br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/223850/extras/for-overclockers-en.png?t=1750844716\" /></div><br>Overclocking is an art that takes skill and precision. The goal is to squeeze every drop of performance out of your GPU and CPU. The reward is a free performance upgrade and the satisfaction of pushing your hardware beyond its stock performance.<br><br>3DMark is an essential tool for overclockers. Run 3DMark before and after overclocking to measure the performance gain. Use custom benchmark settings to explore your PC's performance limits. Make 3DMark tests more or less demanding by changing the resolution and other settings.<br><br>Run 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your overclocks and the effectiveness of your cooling. 3DMark Stress Tests run in a loop to put your system under heavy load for longer than a standard benchmark run.<br><br>Challenge your friends to set the highest 3DMark score or compete for the top spot in the 3DMark Steam leaderboards.<br><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/223850/extras/for-system-builders-en.png?t=1750844716\" /></div><br>If you love PC gaming, there's nothing better than building your own custom PC. And if you build it yourself, there's nothing more nerve-racking than turning it on for the first time. Will it boot? Will everything work properly? Whether you're building a complete system from scratch or upgrading a component, 3DMark has you covered.<br><br>Run 3DMark and compare your benchmark score with similar systems to make sure your new build is set up correctly. Detailed hardware monitoring charts show you how the CPU and GPU load, temperature, and clock speed changed during your benchmark run‚Äîideal for identifying configuration issues.<br><br>Use 3DMark Stress Tests to check the stability of your system and discover faulty hardware while it's still under warranty. Stress testing is also a great way to test and optimize your system's cooling performance. A well-built PC with decent cooling should be able to deliver peak performance for the full duration of a 3DMark Stress Test.<br><br>3DMark can help when you are planning an upgrade as well.

        "description": "Br√ºtal Legend is an action-adventure that marries visceral action combat with open-world freedom. Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it‚Äôs a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike.<br> <br><br>Included as a free bonus in the PC version of Br√ºtal Legend are both the Hammer of Infinite Fate and Tears of the Hextadon multiplayer map packs.<br><br><br><strong>Story</strong><br>The vivid and wildly creative world of Br√ºtal Legend is brought to life through a spate of chrome, leather, rocker babes, epic music, fire-breathing/stud-wearing beasts, mountains made of guitar amps, and more. Follow Eddie as he embarks on a tour of epic destruction with an axe, a guitar, and his minions as he commands the power of rock in epic band battles. It‚Äôs lighter-flicking awesomeness that will melt your face clean off.<br><br><br><strong>Combat</strong><br>Br√ºtal Legend‚Äôs combat is a combination of classic action slasher and real time strategy mechanics.  Melee and ranged combat come from your double-sided broadaxe and demon-slaying, pyrotechnic-creating guitar.  Add that 1-2 punch to a guitar solo mechanic that can summon objects, buff your teammates, or cripple your opponents, and you have a deep, gratifying core gameplay combat loop that is fun for the hardcore and accessible for the casual.  On top of that, players will journey from Roadie to Rock God by commanding legions of metalheads into Br√ºtal Victory and sending troops charging into battle.<br><br><br><strong>A Streaming Open World</strong><br>Br√ºtal Legend gives you the freedom to walk, drive, or fly anywhere in a fully streaming open world whose art style is inspired by some of the most iconic and hilariously rad metal album covers ever created. Every vista in the beautiful universe of Br√ºtal Legend looks like it was pulled from a Frank Frazetta painting.<br><br><br><strong>Packed With Cameos and Voice Talent</strong><br>Br√ºtal Legend is full of cameos from gods of metal like Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Lita Ford, and many, many others. It has a MASSIVE metal soundtrack from every era of metal music: 1970‚Äôs classic metal to 1980‚Äôs hair metal to the scarier cousins of 1990‚Äôs metal. And of course, Jack Black pays the ultimate homage to metal as Eddie the Roadie, continuing the theme from the work of his band, Tenacious D and his previous films like School of Rock and High Fidelity.<br><br><br><strong>Multiplayer Mayhem</strong><br>4v4 &quot;skirmish&quot; multiplayer marries action combat with a strategic unit-control mechanic. As the leader of one of the factions in the game, the player will direct his armies in a Battle of the Bands where the trophy is survival. Br√ºtal Legend‚Äôs multiplayer is online-enabled, so you can conquer your friends online (broadband connection required for online play).<br><br><br><strong>Music</strong><br>The music in Br√ºtal Legend is truly massive. Made up of 108 of the most rocking tracks from 75 different bands representing every sub-genre of metal, it is something to experience in and of itself.",

You play as Aiden Caldwell, a wandering Pilgrim who delivers goods, brings news, and connects the few remaining survivor settlements in barren lands devastated by the zombie virus. However, your true goal is to find your little sister Mia, who you left behind as a kid to escape Dr. Waltz's torturous experiments. Haunted by the past, you eventually make the decision to confront it when you learn that Mia may still be alive in Villedor ‚Äî the last city standing on Earth.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">You quickly find yourself in a settlement torn by conflict. You‚Äôll need to engage in creative and gory combat, so hone your skills to defeat hordes of zombies and make allies. Roam the city, free run across Villedor‚Äôs buildings and rooftops in search of loot in remote areas, and be wary of the night. With every sunset, monsters take control of the streets. </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"> <div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/534380/extras/02_EXPLOREAPOST.gif?t=1739988558\" /></div></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Fifteen years ago, humanity was devastated by the Fall ‚Äî a catastrophic event that would change the world forever. With the Harran virus spreading around the globe, people quickly found out that all hope for tomorrow is lost. By 2036, only a few settlements remain, and humanity is slowly dying, making way for the new species out there ‚Äî a horde of relentless zombies.  </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/534380/extras/03_APPRECIATETHEDAY.gif?t=1739988558\" /></div></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Welcome to Villedor, one of the last bastions of humanity. During the day, survivors still try to have a life here and find a false sense of normalcy. Relationships are formed, dreams are dreamed, and life carries on. On the surface, everything seems‚Ä¶ fine. Until sunset, that is. With the last ray of light dying out, other, more dreadful, dwellers of The City crawl out of their gloomy interiors, taking over the streets. If you are not vigilant and stay out too long in the dark, you may never return. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/534380/extras/04_MOVE_TO_SURVIVE.gif?t=1739988558\" /></div></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Not all fights can be won. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to run and, thankfully, you have the skills for it. Parkour lets you escape when odds are not in your favor. Jump from rooftop to rooftop, swing across the cityscape, ride ziplines, and much more. Whatever you do, experience a unique sense of freedom as you freerun across Villedor‚Äôs buildings and rooftops in search of loot or while running away from the dangers of the night. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/534380/extras/05_GET_CREATIVE_BE_BRUTA.gif?t=1739988558\" /></div></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">In a world as dangerous as this one, only the strongest survive. Whether you prefer to smash, slice or dismember those who stand in your way, you have to be creative about it to make it through. And who says you need weapons? Utilize the entirety of your parkour moveset to get the jump on your enemies. Learn the ways of combat and parkour to feel the crunch of skulls and slices of flesh as you swing weapons or use your moves to fend off any forms of danger. And let‚Äôs not forget that Villedor has weapons that put the most advanced post-apocalyptic armories to shame. </p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/534380/extras/06_GRAB_A_FRIEND_.gif?t=1739988558\" /></div></h2><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Surviving in Villedor is easier with friends.

Unique characters, complex story, and dark imagery presented with striking cel-shaded graphics are all the essential ingredients for this classic title.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">CHARACTER PROFILE</h2><br><strong>Harman Smith</strong><br>The central character in this story. He is an elderly man of 65, physically dependent on his live-in nursing assistant. However, when aroused he shows his true colors as the &quot;God Killer.&quot; His massive armor piercing rifle is one of his professional trademarks.<br>- Weapon: Armor piercing rifle<br><br><strong>Garcian Smith</strong><br>The leader of 7 different personalities and also a loyal servant of Haman. He's low-key and nothing's ever humorous to him. He uses his special telegnosis ability to search and destroy the Heaven Smiles that use optical camouflage.<br>- Weapon: Handgun with Silencer<br><br><strong>Dan Smith</strong><br>The most aggressive personality with the biggest attitude out of the 7. He's dressed cool with a suit and tie. No one will mistake him for a business man, at least not with his big revolver he carries all the time. There is hatred in his eyes. Some even say that if you stare into his eyes, you can see the devil.<br>- Weapon: Custom Magnum<br><br><strong>Mask de Smith</strong><br>A mysterious former professional wrestler, he managed to build quite a following with this unique blend of Lucha Libre and British Lancashire style wrestling. There are rumors of his rampaging maskless through the ranks of the No Holds Barred circuit as well. Just when he had been invited to New York to appear at the main event, he vanished without a trace. His specialty move is known as the Smith Special (usually referred to in wrestling circles as the &quot;burning hammer.&quot;) His double grenade launchers pack a powerful punch and can fire normal, Electric, and Gravity grenades. Animals naturally flock to the young and kind-hearted Babyface.<br>- Weapon: Double Grenade Launchers<br><br><strong>Coyote Smith</strong><br>Like a venomous serpent, he's a cold-blooded personality. A Latino thug who knows his ways in the streets. Coyote is synonymous with the &quot;art of lock-picking.&quot; He's a man who knows how to get things. It's this extraordinary skill that qualifies him as a member of the Smithe Alliance. Also worth mentioning is his ability to take lives brutally.<br>- Weapon: Custom Revolver<br><br><strong>Kevin Smith</strong><br>This albino man uses a knife as his weapon of choice. He can disappear into thin air by taking off his shades. He favors solitude over harmony. They say he's not a man of many words. But in actuality, no one has ever heard him speak. Some rumor that his voice can summon gods.<br>- Weapon: Knives/Throwing Knives<br><br><strong>Kaede Smith</strong><br>The only girl in the killer entourage. She summons hear deadly spirits by blasting out a shower of blood from her wrist. Because she lives a life so close to death, her ability to survive life-or-death situations is beyond that of any living man. Her specialty is long-range shooting. She's able to use a 2-step zoom when firing her weapon. On a personal level she's very passive and tends to keep her distance from others.<br>- Weapon: Automatic Pistol with Scope<br><br><strong>Con Smith</strong><br>The blind boy Con has exceptional hearing that allows him to visualize sounds. He also has an awesome rapid-fire ability. Another nice attribute is his super running speed that if he wanted could outrun almost any enemy. When he's asleep, he's just an average child. Nobody would suspect him of being an elite assassin.<br>- Weapon: Double Automatics<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">ENEMY PROFILE</h2><strong>Kun Lan</strong><br>A parasitic avatar from Haman Smith's past. With the power of the gods, he brought forth the &quot;Heaven Smile.&quot; His plan is to bring down the Federation of States.<br><br><strong>Heaven Smile</strong><br>Violent beings who exist through the hand of Kun Lan. Their sole mode of attacking is to get near their targets and blow themselves up. In urban camouflage, they are very difficult to spot with the naked eye.",

Grow your starting village into a bustling city, manage resources and production chains, and expand your lands through conquest.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Inspired by the art and architecture of late 14th century Franconia, Manor Lords prioritizes historical accuracy wherever possible, using it to inform gameplay mechanics and visuals alike. Common medieval tropes are avoided in favor of historical accuracy in order to make the world feel more authentic, colorful, and believable.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/headline_01ML.png?t=1753379338\" /></div><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/image_02_loop.gif?t=1753379338\" /></div></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Manor Lords provides a gridless city-building experience with full freedom of placement and rotation. Building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns and villages, where major trade routes and the landscape influenced how settlements formed and developed.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Spreading outward from a central marketplace, build your residential, commercial, and industrial districts following the natural lay of the land. Establish farms based on soil fertility, position hunting grounds according to animal populations, and ensure access to adequate resource deposits and forests to provide the raw materials needed for growth.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Assign areas for housing and watch your residents build their homes in accordance with the historical burgage plot system. Each area will be subdivided based on your roads and the allotted space, and homes will scale accordingly.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Build extensions behind larger homes to generate resources that would not otherwise be available. Homeowners don't just pay taxes ‚Äì they grow vegetables, raise chickens and goats, and otherwise supply themselves and other townsfolk with essential needs beyond what your managed farms, pastures, and industries can provide.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Guide your settlements through the unique demands and opportunities of each season, enjoying the bounty brought by spring rains and preparing for the harsh snows of winter.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/headline_02ML.png?t=1753379338\" /></div><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/image_03_loop.gif?t=1753379338\" /></div></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">From boots to barley and hides to honey, Manor Lords features a great variety of goods fitting of the era. Materials need to be transported and processed into finished products through production chains, and you must balance the basic needs of your people against the desire to produce luxury items to ensure happiness, manufacture trade goods for export, or forge arms and armor to aid in your conquests.  </p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Resources are littered across the map, encouraging you to expand and establish multiple specialized settlements. Extract valuable ores from your mining colonies, while villages devoted to agriculture, herding, or hunting supply the grains and meats needed to feed your growing populations. Will you spend your hard-earned influence to first acquire a rich source of iron for your smiths, or will you prioritize regions with fertile soil to serve as your breadbasket? </p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Unchecked expansion will have a direct effect on the environment. Herds of deer will migrate away from encroaching civilization, lack of crop rotation will worsen soil fertility, and cutting down too many trees will result in deforestation.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Establish trade routes and sell surplus goods to traveling merchants to enrich your population. Manufacturing and exporting a variety of goods will provide wealth with which to upgrade your peoples‚Äô homes, import goods you can‚Äôt produce yourself, and through taxes on said wealth, fill your own coffers.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/headline_03ML.png?t=1753379338\" /></div><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/image_04_loop.gif?t=1753379338\" /></div></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Yours is but a small parcel of land in a vast territory, and the competing ambitions between you and rival lords will inevitably lead to conflict. Lead your people into battle, not as expendable units to be easily replenished, but as your beloved loyal subjects where every death is a cost worth considering.</p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Train a retinue of skilled warriors to fight battles alongside the levies you raise from the town militia. At times these soldiers will be needed to suppress banditry, and at other times you will lead your men into battle to conquer or defend territory. When needed, mercenaries are a costly option to bolster your ranks. Will you raise the militia at the first sign of trouble, bringing your economy to a stand-still as your peasants pick up arms and rush to form ranks, or will you spend your personal wealth to hire bands of sellswords instead?</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Command real-time tactical battles, taking into consideration fatigue, weather conditions, and equipment. Position your troops wisely ‚Äì a smaller force can defeat a larger enemy, if commanded well.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">Feel the cost of battle, even in victory, as each fallen soldier represents a lost person from your city.</p></li></ul><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/headline_04ML.png?t=1753379338\" /></div><div class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1363080/extras/image_05_loop.gif?t=1753379338\" /></div></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\"></p><p class=\"bb_paragraph\">This game is a passion project started by a solo developer, grown through player support into a full team of passionate individuals ranging from programmers and 2D artists to Game and Map Designers.

The Dark Gods are at last united in a singular purpose, losing their madness across the world as never before. In the Empire of Sigmar, Karl Franz's gaze is focused on the incursion of the savage northmen, but it is not the only threat. As the Chaos moon Morrslieb waxes full, shrill voices echo through tunnels gnawed far beneath the Empire's cities, and a Skaven host swarms towards the surface. It emerges first in the city of Ubersreik, a screeching mass that consumes all before it. Soon Ubersreik is a charnel-town, drowning beneath the malevolent shadow of the Horned Rat. <br><br>Yet even in the darkest times, there are always champions to light the way. As Ubersreik cowers, five heroes, united by capricious fate, carry the fight to the rat-men. It remains to be seen whether they have the strength to survive, let alone work together long enough to thwart the invaders. One truth, however, is beyond all doubt: should these five fall, then Ubersreik will fall with them. </i>",

Fight your way through waves of responsive targets, samurai, and highly dangerous ninjas - all while drawing, nocking, and shooting your arrows as quickly as possible. <br><br>Holopoint is a skill based game where progression is based on player skill and training rather than unlocks. Like many arcade style games, personal progress and a high score is the goal. There are two game-modes: Original, and Time-Trial.<br>The original game mode offers sixty waves to progress through. Targets are introduced as groups of waves are completed. This mode quickly becomes difficult and requires an active mindset. Holopoint is designed so that only a few determined archers will reach the last wave.<br>Time-Trial allows player to define a subset of targets and a play-time, during which points are awarded for targets hit, and taken away when a target hits back. This game mode offers a more casual and controlled experience, and is used by many as a timed workout.<br><br>WARNING: THIS GAME GETS INTENSE.
