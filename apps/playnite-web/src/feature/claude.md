# Features

Major feature areas are grouped into a feature directory. Code shared among many features is located in the `feature/shared` feature directory. Although feature directories may have different structures depending on the needs, they follow these patterns:

- components are placed in a components directory; possibly grouped within sub-directories by like things
- hooks - React hooks used by feature
